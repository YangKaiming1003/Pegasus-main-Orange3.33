# Pegasus

=======

1) Rename Orange to "Pegasus 2". Replace Orange logo with Pegasus logo (I will provide). DONE.

2) Rename "World Happiness" widget to "Economic Indices". Let's mark it as DONE.

3) Help Tab - About - change from "Orange" to "Pegasus 2", remove links to videos and documentation. DONE.

4) Create a new widget - "Data validation" and incorporate this functionality as a separate widget: https://github.com/yanhong-zhao-ef/robyn-data-validation

5) Create a new widget -"Media Mix Modelling" and incorporate this functionality as a separate widget: https://github.com/sibylhe/mmm_stan

(here is a working Jupyter notebook if it helps: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gfaxDAMI0OaJE3XQ-txpOe-Lb0UHOXhc)
Finally, it needs to be recompiled as an executable file (which can be installed without administrative privileges).
